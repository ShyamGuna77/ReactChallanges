# Shopping Cart UI Challenge

## Goal

Build a shopping cart UI that separates **in-stock** and **out-of-stock** items into two tables.

## Tasks

1. Update the `CartTable` component:

   - Use iteration to display items.
   - Ensure each row has a unique `key` prop.

2. Update the `App` component:
   - Render two `CartTable` components:
     - One for **in-stock** items (under "Shopping Cart").
     - One for **out-of-stock** items (under "Sold Out").

## Acceptance Criteria

- All items from the server are displayed.
- Items are split into "in-stock" and "out-of-stock."
- No key warnings in the console.
