# <span style="color: #DA70D6;"> Color Gradient App Challenge </span>

## Description

Hey everyone! 👩‍💻👨‍💻

I’ve written a small app that lets users pick two colors and apply them as a linear gradient background. But there’s a problem in the code that prevents the app from updating the colors properly when the user changes them.

## Live Demo

 Check out the live Demo in [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/nhvhjy?file=/App.js&utm_medium=sandpack)

## Task

1. Review the code and **identify** the issue that prevents the state from being updated correctly.
2. **Fix the issue** so that when a user picks a new color, the background gradient updates to reflect the change.
3. Make sure the app is **dynamic** and can handle changing the gradient colors correctly for both color pickers.


## Your Job:
- Fix the code so it updates properly when a user changes a color.
- Test the solution to see if the gradient updates dynamically as expected!
