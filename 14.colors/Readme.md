# <span style="color: #DA70D6;"> Colors Add Remove</span>

## Description

- Let's keep working on our gradient generator tool! Instead of limiting the user to 2 colors, we'll let them add up to `5 colors`.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. The color inputs should work; picking a new color should update the gradient accordingly.

2. Clicking `‚ÄúAdd color‚Äù` should add a new color, at the end of the array.
3. Clicking `"Remove color"` should remove the last color in the array.
4. When adding new colors, they should default to `#FF0000`(bright red).
5. There should always be between 2 and 5 colors. No more, no less.

## Addition Challange

- When the user removes and then re-adds a color, it should be restored to the previously-set value, rather than being reset to #FF0000.
