# UseId() HOOK 

- The useId hook in React is used to generate unique IDs for elements, particularly useful when dealing with accessibility features like associating labels with inputs or ensuring unique identifiers in lists.

## Why use useId?
- To generate unique IDs across the client and server, preventing mismatches during hydration.
- To avoid manually managing unique IDs for components.
Useful for creating accessible components that rely on unique identifiers.

 ### Practice â€” Toggle component
- In this sandbox, you'll find a Toggle component that has been almost fully implemented.

- Finish it up by adding a unique ID to the button, and connecting it to the label. You should be able to trigger the toggle by clicking the "Dark Mode" text.
