# Clean Up the UseEffect Function 

# Description 

Let's build a digital clock with React!

Below, you'll find a clock that initializes at the correct value, but it doesn't update. Your mission is to update the code so that the clock shows the correct time:

## Live Demo 
 The starter Code available in [codeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/8z6jrf?file=%2FClock.js&utm_medium=sandpack)

# # Acceptance Criteria:

- The clock should update once per second, to show the current time.
- There should be no memory leaks, no ongoing processes that outlive the Clock instance.
